Hello!
I am Yuta Koreeda (是枝祐太), an industry researcher based in Japan.
I am currently working at the Central Research Laboratory of Hitachi, Ltd.

My research interests include natural language processing (NLP), applied machine learning, and human-computer interaction.

I completed my master's degree in mechanical engineering at Waseda University, under the supervision of Professor Masakatsu G. Fujie.
My research at that time focused on the intersection of computer vision, robotics, and human-machine interaction, within the broader field of computer-assisted surgery.

Since then, I have gradually transitioned towards robotics, intelligent systems, and NLP by 2016.
My current research primarily involves applying NLP techniques to real-world problems --- carefully analyzing these problems and transforming them into solvable NLP tasks.
