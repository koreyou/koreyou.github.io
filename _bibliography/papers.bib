To this end, we designed a novel Plain Graph Notation (PGN) that handles various graphs universally. Then, our parser predicts a PGN-based sequence by leveraging Transformers and biaffine attentions. Notably, our parser can handle any PGN-formatted graphs with fewer framework-specific modifications. As a result, ensemble versions of the parser tied for 1st place in both cross-framework and cross-lingual tracks.",

In this task, a system is given a set of hypotheses (such as {``}Some obligations of Agreement may survive termination.{''}) and a contract, and it is asked to classify whether each hypothesis is {``}entailed by{''}, {``}contradicting to{''} or {``}not mentioned by{''} (neutral to) the contract as well as identifying {``}evidence{''} for the decision as spans in the contract. We annotated and release the largest corpus to date consisting of 607 annotated contracts. We then show that existing models fail badly on our task and introduce a strong baseline, which (a) models evidence identification as multi-label classification over spans instead of trying to predict start and end tokens, and (b) employs more sophisticated context segmentation for dealing with long documents. We also show that linguistic characteristics of contracts, such as negations by exceptions, are contributing to the difficulty of this task and that there is much room for improvement.",

Conventional preprocessing tools for VSDs mainly focused on word segmentation and coarse layout analysis, whereas fine-grained logical structure analysis (such as identifying paragraph boundaries and their hierarchies) of VSDs is underexplored. To that end, we proposed to formulate the task as prediction of {``}transition labels{''} between text fragments that maps the fragments to a tree, and developed a feature-based machine learning system that fuses visual, textual and semantic cues. Our system is easily customizable to different types of VSDs and it significantly outperformed baselines in identifying different structures in VSDs. For example, our system obtained a paragraph boundary detection F1 score of 0.953 which is significantly better than a popular PDF-to-text tool with an F1 score of 0.739.",

However, little is known about what type of task formulation is suitable for the task. To this end, this paper explores various task formulations, including sequence classification, question answering, and question answering with chain-of-thought prompting and evaluates their performances on the shared task dataset. Experiments show that a zero-shot approach is not as effective as other methods, and there is no one approach that is optimal in every scenario.

Though it is a pain point for many developers, automatically creating one remains a challenge even with the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), because it requires generating an abstract description from thousands of lines of code. In this demo paper, we show that LLMs are capable of generating a coherent and factually correct readmes if we can identify a code fragment that is representative of the repository. Building upon this finding, we developed LARCH (LLM-based Automatic Readme Creation with Heuristics) which leverages representative code identification with heuristics and weak supervision. Through human and automated evaluations, we illustrate that LARCH can generate coherent and factually correct readmes in the majority of cases, outperforming a baseline that does not rely on representative code identification. We have made LARCH open-source and provided a cross-platform Visual Studio Code interface and command-line interface, accessible at https://github.com/hitachi-nlp/larch.
