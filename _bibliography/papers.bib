In this task, a system is given a set of hypotheses (such as {``}Some obligations of Agreement may survive termination.{''}) and a contract, and it is asked to classify whether each hypothesis is {``}entailed by{''}, {``}contradicting to{''} or {``}not mentioned by{''} (neutral to) the contract as well as identifying {``}evidence{''} for the decision as spans in the contract. We annotated and release the largest corpus to date consisting of 607 annotated contracts. We then show that existing models fail badly on our task and introduce a strong baseline, which (a) models evidence identification as multi-label classification over spans instead of trying to predict start and end tokens, and (b) employs more sophisticated context segmentation for dealing with long documents. We also show that linguistic characteristics of contracts, such as negations by exceptions, are contributing to the difficulty of this task and that there is much room for improvement.",

In this demo paper, we show that LLMs are capable of generating a coherent and factually correct readmes if we can identify a code fragment that is representative of the repository. Building upon this finding, we developed LARCH (LLM-based Automatic Readme Creation with Heuristics) which leverages representative code identification with heuristics and weak supervision. Through human and automated evaluations, we illustrate that LARCH can generate coherent and factually correct readmes in the majority of cases, outperforming a baseline that does not rely on representative code identification.

   abstract = "Language models (LMs) are becoming the foundation for almost all major language technologies, but their capabilities, limitations, and risks are not well understood. We present Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) to improve the transparency of language models. First, we taxonomize the vast space of potential scenarios (i.e. use cases) and metrics (i.e. desiderata) that are of interest for LMs. Then we select a broad subset based on coverage and feasibility, noting what’s missing or underrepresented (e.g. question answering for neglected English dialects, metrics for trustworthiness). Second, we adopt a multi-metric approach: We measure 7 metrics (accuracy, calibration, robustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, and efficiency) for each of 16 core scenarios to the extent possible (87.5\% of the time), ensuring that metrics beyond accuracy don’t fall to the wayside, and that trade-offs across models and metrics are clearly exposed. We also perform 7 targeted evaluations, based on 26 targeted scenarios, to more deeply analyze specific aspects (e.g. knowledge, reasoning, memorization/copyright, disinformation). Third, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of 30 prominent language models (spanning open, limited-access, and closed models) on all 42 scenarios, including 21 scenarios that were not previously used in mainstream LM evaluation. Prior to HELM, models on average were evaluated on just 17.9\% of the core HELM scenarios, with some prominent models not sharing a single scenario in common. We improve this to 96.0\%: now all 30 models have been densely benchmarked on a set of core scenarios and metrics under standardized conditions. Our evaluation surfaces 25 top-level findings concerning the interplay between different scenarios, metrics, and models. For full transparency, we release all raw model prompts and completions publicly for further analysis, as well as a general modular toolkit for easily adding new scenarios, models, metrics, and prompting strategies. We intend for HELM to be a living benchmark for the community, continuously updated with new scenarios, metrics, and models.",

Recent work proposed to model split-and-rephrase as a supervised sequence generation problem. However, different from other types of sequence generations, the task of split-and-rephrase inevitably introduces overlaps across splits to compensate for the missing context caused by separating a sentence. Serving as the baseline of this task, the vanilla SEQ2SEQ model usually suffers from inappropriate duplication because of the lack of a mechanism to plan how the source sentence should be split into shorter units. This work demonstrates that the problem of inappropriate duplication can be tackled by explicitly modeling the hierarchy within split-and-rephrase: Our model first introduces a separator network capable of selecting semantic components from the source sentence to form a representation for each split. Then, a decoder generates each split on the basis of its representation. Analyses demonstrate that with the aid of the separator, a model can effectively learn attention to avoid duplication and detect clues for splitting a sentence. Experimental results on the WikiSplit corpus show that our model outperforms the non-hierarchical SEQ2SEQ model by 1.4 points in terms of duplication rate and by 0.3 points in terms of coverage rate.",

  abstract = {This paper describes a technique to recognize "supportiveness" of a given text for an argument topic object and a value. Given an argument topic object (o), a value (v), and a text fragment (t), supportiveness refers to whether t supports a hypothesis "o promotes/suppresses v" or not. For example, with "o: casino" and "v: employment", then a text "The casinos in Mississippi have created 35,000 jobs." should support a hypothesis "o promotes v". This technique enables to automatically collect texts representing reasons and counterexamples for some hypothesis that humans build up (e.g. "casino promotes employment"), combined with text search. Because the difference from relation extraction is polarity of relations, proposed method utilizes multiplifications based on local syntax structures, extending reversing hypothesis in sentiment analysis. We propose feature combinations consisting of "primary features" and "secondary features" for supportiveness recognition. "Primary features" represent local syntax structures around a given target or a given value. "Secondary features" represent global syntax structures generated by combining the primary features. The proposed method calculates weighted sum of secondary features to recognize promoting/suppressing supportiveness. The experiments showed that our method outperforms a Bag-of-Words baseline and a conventional relation extraction method.},

  abstract = {In recent years, development of the automated driving system is aggressively promoted for the purpose of reducing burden of drivers and for the enhanced safety. Transferring the intention of the driver to the automobile control, such as to stop on the way or to change destinations, is essential even if a direct control from the driver is no longer necessary. Therefore, an in-car interface to conduct intention of the driver promptly and accurately to the automobile control is needed. In this paper, we proposed an interface which recognizes the intended target of the driver using gestures and speech recognition. The speech recognition technology was previously developed. Hence, we developed an interface to recognize the direction in which the driver is pointing toward from the gesture. We hypothesize that we can estimate the direction in which the driver is pointing toward from the fingertip and eye position. Verification using three-dimensional motion analysis system showed that it is possible to recognize the direction of the object with a maximum error of 5.5° and an average error of 1.2°. After verifying the hypothesis, a position measurement device that integrates Leap Motion® and KINECT®, the non-contact sensor, was developed to recognize gestures of the driver in the automobiles. The maximum error of the angle recognition in accordance with the present device was 16.1°. However, the value of the error exists only in a certain interval. For this reason, by taking into account the movement of the eye position, and provide adequate tuning for each driver, proposed interface is sufficiently
usable.},

In addition to binocular parallax, such as three-dimensional vision, shadow is essential for depth perception. This paper presents an augmented reality system that draws virtual shadows to aid depth perception. On the visual display, the system generates shadows that mimic actual shadows by estimating shadow positions using image processing. The distance and angle between the forceps tip and the surface were estimated to evaluate the accuracy of the system. To validate the usefulness of this system in surgical applications, novices performed suturing tasks with and without the augmented reality system. The system error and delay were sufficiently small, and the generated shadows were similar to actual shadows. Furthermore, the suturing error decreased significantly when the augmented reality system was used. The shadow-drawing system developed in this study may help surgeons perceive depth during laparoscopic surgery.},

Binocular endoscope helps surgeons to recognize the depth, but surgeons do not understand the circumstance by equipping with head mounted display. Since shadow helps surgeon to recognize the depth, in this paper, we developed the virtual shadow drawing system. The system shows shadow like actual by the estimation of the forceps position, surface shape and shadow's position. We tested the accuracy of the system by evaluating the estimated distance and angle between the forceps and the surface. The error and delay were enough small to draw shadow like actual. Furthermore, participants performed the suturing task while looking at the shadow. The experiment was carried out in a variety of the shadow's direction. As result, the suturing error's mean and variance value was the least at the 270 deg. In conclusion, the appropriate shadow would be vertical to the wounds.},

Keeping up the quality of F-term annotation is critical to patentability assessments, thus there is a demand for an automatic way to assist F-term annotation. One potential solution is to point out annotation mistakes by utilizing machine learning-based classification. However, the annotators cannot validate the predicted corrections because conventional classification methods do not give the rationales behind the corrections. Thus, the annotators may only adopt all or no corrections. The goal of this study was to assist F-term annotation by presenting annotators with corrections on the F-term annotation and the rationales behind the corrections. We proposed a joint neural model for F-term annotation and rationale identification. The proposed method incorporates a large portion of data annotated only with F-terms and a small portion of data annotated with rationales. It was first trained for F-term annotation, and then fine-tuned using the ground-truth rationales to discriminate rationales from non-rationales. We evaluated the proposed method on multiple F-terms from different technical domains. The proposed method outperformed baseline methods in terms of the rationale identification, implying that incorporating rationales in training is particularly useful in identifying rationales.},

Even though there exist much larger unidirectional LMs such as Llama-2, they are rarely used to replace the token representation of bidirectional LMs. In this work, we hypothesize that their lack of bidirectionality is what is keeping unidirectional LMs behind. To that end, we propose to newly train a small backward LM and concatenate its representations to those of an existing LM for downstream tasks. Through experiments in token-classification tasks, we demonstrate that introducing backward model can improve the benchmark performance by more than 10 points. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method is especially effective for rare domains and in few-shot learning settings.",
